    Screenshot of GRID defining AOI
    
Often time the provided orthoimages contain areas you don't need.
In this step, you can define an area of interest (AOI) to 
exclude the redundant parts.
 
Draw AOI
----------

To draw AOI, 
left-click on the image **four times** to assign 
four corners of the AOI rectangle.
The red shaded region will be AOI used in the analysis.
